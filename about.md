![Bitscout](https://ubywz0glkz-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/cyber-security-5-e1495012599208.jpg)



Bitscout is customizable live OS constructor tool written purely in bash. It's
main purpose is to help you quickly create own remote forensics bootable disk 
image.

This project was created by security researchers for security researchers and 
incident handlers. Do not expect user-friendly interface and if you are not
familiar with Linux commandline, it's wise idea to learn that first. This
constructor can be customised to include your tools, however one of the core
ideas was to remotely assist Law Enforcement investigations as well as incident
responders, which is why Bitscout by default includes a number of forensic
packages and settings. 

## Features
- Responsive
- trusted, transparent and opensource (you build your own OS!)
- customisable (you put your own tools!)
- stable and reliable
- optimal and compact
- fast and optimal (with low RAM usage)
- free of charge
- runs on old and new hardware
